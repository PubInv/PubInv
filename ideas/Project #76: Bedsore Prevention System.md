# Bedsore Prevention System Base on Aquatic Support

This idea was gifted to Public Invention by Lawrence Kincheloe (@LokiMetSmith).

I've been kicking around a concept for long term care facilities, which have a unique problem of needing to rotate the patient in a bed on a regular basis to prevent bed sores. 
Which got me thinking of the other time humans tend to spend months in a location naturally, and that is in the womb. 

So this would be a modified single person hot tub, the water would be filled with salt such that the human body becomes slightly positively buoyant, such that drowning isn't an issue. 
A neck pillow preserver is added to ensure this. 
The water is pumped through a salt water skimmer and chlorinator such that bodily waste is sucked up and cycled out of the water system. 
Such systems already exist for pools and can be modified for this purpose. 

The final piece is a thick sticky layer of grease that gets applied to the patient. 
This acts as "baby cheese" and is a natural production of the skin as the skin cells slough off and grease adheres to the skin due to a lack of friction. 
This happens on the inside of casts when someone breaks a bone. 
The skin inside of the cast becomes a sticky yellowish brown material that is quite greasy. 
This helps keep the patient from experiencing damage from constant contact with water. 

From a labor saving standpoint, this would dramatically reduce the number of nursing staff required to oversee patients. 
This approach would also only be appropriate for patients who are in a coma, medically induced or otherwise. 
I do recognize the many challenges with interfacing modern medical monitoring and life support equipment in a salt water bath, but I believe these are solvable.
