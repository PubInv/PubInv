# Solar-Ice

(from Art Malm) 

## The Concept

While on a mision in Puerto Rico, Art Malm and I saw a lot of needs, but one that Art is familiar with is the need for cooling.
Here presents the following idea:

Build a solar-powered ice machine. He imagines a machine that makes 100 pounds of ice a day.

From Rob:

At a basic level, this may already exist. If not we, can certainly save money by not using an inverter, and making a 12V system.
Basically we only need a smart solar charger, a panel, and the ice making apparatus.  If intelligent monitorying could be used to
controller the compressor in such a way that a battery is not needed (or may be made small), the whole system would be 
far more efficient.


## Note (added May, 2019)

It would seem that this product: https://www.wired.com/story/dometic-electric-coolers/ (The Dometic CFX electric cooler) would be a good solution to this, if paired with a properly sized solar panel. So it seems that thhis is no longer an idea that rises to the level of "invention", but of course it would still be useful for some one to write up how to use this in an emergency situation.
