Note: These are my loose notes, this has not been edited for public consumption.

I would like to understand what happens when you subject human waste to pressure cooking.  My supposition is that it turns into oil.

Can we use this to build a machine that will do this efficiently?

Idea: Inject chemicals for saponization to make soap instead of oil, perhaps thereby allowing the resultant to simply be poured out on the ground safely.

My basic assumption is that we can somehow build a very small chamber which can be placed under tremendous heat and pressure safely.  The question then becomes what is the rapiditity with which we can carry on this process.

It seems obvious that this can be done with solar power.

As Buckminster Fuller said, “Pollution is a resource out of place.”

Note:

I now believe one of the simplest systems that we can imagine is a “hydraulic fire piston”.  We can use water as the hydraulic fluid.  The basic idea is to use a long coil to create a long fire piston, which is slowly compressed using a water tank with a cheap air pump.  There is a one-way valve that pushes air into the fire chamber.  The fire chamber contains the payload and has a control valve that allows pressure to be released.

Note: It is possible that the tank and “coil” could be made out of bricks and concrete.  This represents a very low-cost way to deal with this.

Research:

The average person poops one pound per day.  Let’s call this 500 grams.

So assuming a target temperature of 250 C starting at 30 C we must raise 500 grams 220 C, or 500 * 220 = 110K calories are needed.  One calorie = 3.08596003 foot pounds.  So we have to raise the waste to 330K foot pounds.  This is 124 Watt Hours. So unless we recover the energy through the depolymerization we are not likely to have much luck here. So this is a very challenging problem.

Note: combustion of proteins results in diatomic Nitrogen in general.

Note: Why not create a hydraulic cone hammer? Hydraulic cone hammer should be able to develop tremendous pressure--almost a shock-wave type effect.  What can we do with that?  Can we get a chemical change based on that?  Can we convert, or combust, a popcorn kernel? Should be easy to build this.

Note: You can buy an 80 PSI pressure chamber for $800 --- 5 gallons.  Comes with a gage.

250 C = 482 F.

Note: Can get reactor vessel : http://www.highpressure.com/products/reactors-pressure-vessels/series-ms-micro-reactors/

up to 800F and 60,000 PSI.

Autoclave reactor vessels are also possible: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hydrothermal-Autoclave-Reactor-vessel-kettle-with-Teflon-Chamber-Hydrothermal-Synthesis-150ml/32265383705.html

Note, there are even polymerization reactors.

Note, The Bill and Melinda Gates sponsored a “reinvent the toilet” project, and gave grants to many different things.

Note that separating urine from feces may be practical.

I believe we could distill urine and perform microwave drying of feces.  Dried feces is mostly pathogen free.  Some people have performed charring or incineration of the dried feces to further process it.

I think if we used microwave drying under vacuum pressure, combined with distillation of the urine, we might end up with a usable system.

Urine quickly becomes pathogen-free due to urea breaking down to form ammonia which raises the pH. However, ammonia itself is noxious.  Ammonia oxidizes easily, however.

Note: Crazy idea: feed dried feces slowly to worms, forcing worms to transport from non-safe to safe areas.

Note: Hydrogen sulfide is a problem, but is relatively easily dealt with through iron filings, aeration, or oxidation.

So we could imagine a system that had components:

Urine vault,
Feces vault,
Feces microwave dryer,
Vacuum for drying and distilling,
Distilling column,
Water discharge mechanism,
Urine waste discharge mechanism,
Fecal waste discharge mechanism.


Idea grind feces into a bed if active caproohagous mushrooms. If disoered can we get extremely rapid absorption and odor abatement?



If fungus is maintained at high ratio perhaps so?  We could seal a container for some time if needed. Arduinis and sensors make this more reasonable.

Surely this is worth experimenting with?

Could develop good bacterial measuring mechanisms as well. 

Then every day take a fraction and eject to keep the machine in balance.

Note we could presterilize the waste but it is unclear what purpose that would serve.

How do you know when it us done? Detection of hydrogen sulfide? 

Work with IHUb Kenya.




Note ferrous chloride inhibits hydrogen sulfide production

Note: I now believe an interesting idea is to try to building the smallest aneerobic digester possible.  This is a chance to test some electronic possibilities.

Reading about anearobic digestion, it is clear that biogas production is pretty easy.  The composting process may be harder.

Note, we can also use solar insolation as a heat source.

Let’s find Brian Lang and Mike Appel and ask them what happened.

Great working being done here:

But that is on a very large scale.

What if we go down to an even smaller scale as a prank: We build a doggie pooper scooper that completely deals with waste on the spot!

It would be funny of course, and silly, but it illustrates the point that small is beautiful, and in this case, fast is beautiful.  We want to use electric power to perform TDP on a small amount, which should produce enough heat for us to continue the process?  (Is that really true---need to work out the power equations.)


Note: This looks like a great organization to work with.

Problem: We would rather get rid of the gas without combustion. It would be better if all hydrocarbons came out as liquid.
