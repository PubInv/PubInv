# Making 3D Printed Molds for Tree Shaping

After creating this, I learned of the practice of [Tree Shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaping), which
subsumes what I had imagined.

However, in 2019 we can mke a bit o a twist on this idea: 3D printing molds or "collars" to place on the tree.

Note that many practicitoners of tree shaping value the living, shaped tree, but we can also imagine valuing the 
wooden object cut from the tree (either pruned from a branch or killing the tree.)

Let’s use 3-D printing to construct molds that we can use to force trees into a particular shape.  
We could then “grow” a chair -- possibly a living chair, or possibly a wood-skeleton chair.

Possibly these molds would have to then be cast into Aluminum.



Note that with a 3D printer, we could make a large mold out of Interlocking pieces. In fact, we could even imagine
metal interlocking pieces which we receive a plastic insert which further modifies the shape. In his way we might 
be able to use only easy-to-print molds that require not casting but can still be used.

We could imagine creating a "jenny lind" style chair leg grown directly as a branch on a tree without killing the 
tree.

Can we reliable create a Y-splitter? That is, can we in some way reliably know that a tree will branch into two,
which we can then  potentially bring back together?

This is more of an art project than design project!

What is a fast growing woody herb that we could do with this?  Or some shrub---box perhaps? Bamboo obviously,
although it is highly jointed.

Would not a grown, wooden Caryatid be a thing of great beauty?

I imagine this as a new form of sculpture requiring tremendous patience.

Imagine walking through a park where the trees had been sculpted to be playing children!

This would be a fun project because it would involve art, 3D printing, botany, and perhaps the development of new 
techniques for working with living plants.

>Ludwig’s Baubotanik, however, goes one step further. By incorporating a vegetal component to metal scaffolding and other construction materials, a living, breathing building is formed. Over time, as the trees age, their fused joints continue to strengthen, providing further load bearing support. Indeed, the ability of growing trees to incorporate foreign materials such as metal and plastic highlights the potential of Baubotanikal structures in urban design.[^2]

Ludwig's work was inspired by the ancient living root bridges of Meghalaya[^3], which increase their strength over time as the roots grow stronger, the opposite of traditional civil engineering design, which erodes gradually until decommission and replacement.
