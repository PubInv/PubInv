# Project #80 - Ferrofluid Piston

Public Invention is working on two ideas related to ferrofluid, the most developed of which is the ferrofluid check valve.
In general, we (and many other researchers) would like a general toolkit of techniques for manipulating ferrofluid.
The idea of using a ferrofluid blob (or bolus) moved by magnets has been described in numerous papers. 

However, we have not seen the idea of a ferrofluid piston that attempts to optimize the ability to pressurize a gas.
That is, it is simple, and has been done repeatedly, to move a ferrofluid bolus in a cylinder (or tube, or channel) with a
mooving permanent magnet or a series of electromagnets. However, if the purpose of this is to actually create a pressure in the gas,
for example, for the purpose of building a compressor or because the pressureized gas is inherently valuable for some chemical reaction
or even for building an internal combustion engine, then a the problem requires more care.

If you had a long cylinder with 10 electromagnets of the same size ranged around if of the same side but the pressure against which the bolus
is working is increasing as the bolus moves, it seems inefficient to have all magnets of the same size.
