# NanoJointStockCompanies

The [Joint-Stock Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company), with the added assumption that profits are intended to be distributed on a prorata share basis, 
is a fundamental mathematical tool for human organization. In the form of corporations that are legally recognized, it allows large ventures to be financed and 
creates a conveniently liquid market to buy and sell investments. This creates a way for firms to raise capital.

Let assign the legal notion of a corporation and thinking on a smaller scale, we can just the idea of joint-stock to incentive commitment to various activities,
even if not money is expected. I could say to "If you help me dig this garden, I will give you 2/5ths of the tomatoes we get this summer." Let's assume that
I will not be offended if you promise to give half of your share (1/5th) of the total to a friend you loans you a shovel and a pair of gloves. In essence,
we have create a micro- or nano-joint-stock company. It has five shares, I have 3, you have 1, and your friend who owns a shovel has 1. So long as we all know and trust each other, all is
well for this tiny endeavor. This organization has no legal standing as a corporation, and needs none.

Let us consider, however, another use case. Suppose that I want to have 100 people cooperate in writing a software project called P. 
The future value of this software is highly speculative and risky, and probably quite small, and is likely to zero,
even though the expected value is greater than zero. In this case, perhaps none of the contributors is willing to 
work more than a small amount, and does not need present compensation; but nonetheless I entice the to do the work
by promising them a share of future profits. Those profits might, in fact, be in the form of gift or a donation.

Now let us suppose that the project works for a year and becomes quiescent for a year. 
Let us then suppose that it starts up again with a new set of volunteers. How should there shares
be valued against the previous shares?

The accepted way this works in a corporation is that the current shareholders appoint decision makers and/or approve
offer new shares to the new workers. These new shares dilute the old shares in a perfectly mathematically understandable
way. The shareholders feel this dilution is worthwhile in order to obtain addtional labor.

Now let us suppose that another software project called Q comes to us and says "We really need you to add Feature X
to your software to make it valuble to us, but we have no money; however, we can give you Y shares of our project."
Let us suppose that we agree this is a reasonable bargain.

Under very basic assumptions, if a donation is made to Q, and Q decides to pay a divided. Project P gets a fraction 
of this donation based on its shares. If Project P chooses not to hold any capital, it can immediate pay this as a 
dividend to its shareholders.

In a sense, this is a happy situation. The workers in both the second round of volunteers get a small reward, proportional 
to what they agreed to work for. Future volunteers may see value in working for shares.

# The Fundamental Problem Is Simple

A vast network of such nano-joint-stock companies could be organized. The fundamental problem is just keeping track
of who owns how many shares, and which identities has the power to create and transfer shares.
This is simple if everything is made completely public and done with transparent, immutable accounting.
That is our recommendation.

# The Crypto Non-Solution

Of course it is tempting to create "coins" and allow identities to be anonymous, proven by some cryptographic means.
This would work and probably has some advantages; but it is an enormous headache and really unneeded.
