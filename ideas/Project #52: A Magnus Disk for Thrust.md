# Project #52: A Magnus Disk for Thrust

The Magnus effect is the ability of a spinning cylinder to generate thrust by diverting a moving fluid stream. It has been used, in combination with
natural wind or a propeller, to move ships (rotor ships) and even provide lift for aircraft.

Can we instead generate thust by having a roating disk with protusions, which uses centrifugal force to generate air velocity with no additional apparatus?

Imainge disk like an old vinaly record. Now imagine that this is warped, so as to have five raised edges and five lowered edges. If we mounted
this disk on a drill and spun it, we would imagine that air might be gently drawn in from the center on both sides and pushed outward.
If you held your and near the edge, you would feel a breeze away from the center of the disk.

However, it would provide no thrust, because it is completely symmetric. Suppose now that you closed one side of it by sealing the wavy edges against
another record album. You would then have a shape which was wavy on the top but flat on the bottom.

Spinning this would generate more outward velocity on the top than on the bottom. I hypothesize it would generate thrust in the direction of the wavy face,
away from the flat face.

Such a system would have the advantage of potential safety; that is, unlike a rotor, which obviously is dangeours if it smacks into something,
this system would be a bit safer (touch a rapidly moving surface is still dangerous, but less so.)

I personally doubt that the thrust could equal that of foil shaped rotors, but I don't know that.

This would be easy to test: Design a three-dimensional shape, print it, attach it to a dremel, spinit at high RPM and see if it moves.

Note that this might be even more effective underwater, where speed of rotation could be far lower for reasonable thrust. One might imagine a 
submarine (or submersible drone) that could never be fouled by seaweed or underwater cables. (Counter rotation might be required to keep the entire
vehicle from spinning.)
