# Conical Ferrofluid Piston

The piston is one of the simplest machines. It converts fluidic pressure into force, which usually produces linear motion.

In general, the area of the piston does not change, because the piston is made or a solid material.

However, if we make a piston out of a fluid, the area of the piston may change through its cycle.
The use of a liquid or a fluid as a piston is somewhat unusual. 
Ferrofluid, however, motivates the idea of creating a piston made out of fluid, because
ferrofluid can be directly acted upon by a magnetic field.

In particular, it may be possible to intentionally change the area of the piston 
in its cycle to better match the pressure that we are either creating with the piston
or are extracting power from with the piston.

In a sense, this is a modification of the multiplicative power of hydraulic machines 
applied to a new area.

In particular, suppose that we are using a piston to compress a gas. 
If a piston is a disc in a closed cylinder, then the pressure increases as the 
piston moves, making the volume in the closed cylinder smaller. This increase
in pressure requires an increase in force, if the area remains the same.
However, if we are using a ferrofluid piston, we could reduce the area as 
the pressure increases. Since force is pressure times area, this would reduce
the force neede dot move the piston. We could thus design a compression stroke
of a piston which has in fact a constant force.

# A Pump Needs a Piston

Public Invention has developed a ferrofluid check (one-way) valve that
uses only ferrofluid in a magnetic field. 
If you place a chamber between two check valves pointing in the same 
direction and can vary the volume of the chamber, for example with a piston,
then you have simple positive displacement pump.

It would be very useful to have an efficient, powerful piston that
has no moving parts except ferrofluid which is activated by electromagnets.
Such a basic machine would let us build pumps and perhaps other simple machines
which have only ferrofluid as moving parts.

# Goals

The purpose of this project is to build a piston that consists only 
of ferrofluid (and perhaps a gas) in some sort of container which has
two wires coming from it. When a voltage is applied across the wires,
the piston should activate, moving one face of the ferrofluid somehow.

# Ideas

We hyphothesize that we could build a cone within a cone, sharing the same
axis.
If the interior cone was made the South pole of a magent and the exterior cone
the North pole of a magnet, it would form a magnetic circuit that would strongly
attract ferrofluid to fill the gap between the cones.
Such a magnet circuit is easy to make by attaching the cones with a ferrous metal
and wrapping a coil arround the attaching piece.
This makes a "horse shoe" magnet, where the gap happens to have a very peculiar
conical shape.
The beauty of the cone is that its area change as you move toward the apex;
so you get an automatic change in area, which could be designed to match 
a change in pressure.

# A Squirt Gun

1. Could we make a ferrofluid "squirt gun" in this way?
2. If we can make a "squirt gun", can we use it to make a pump, perhaps by having many injectors?
3. If you apply voltage to this cone and a reservoir of ferrofluid, does it push a non-magnetic material smoothly
 out as it is energized, or doe weird "bubbles" get trapped in it?
