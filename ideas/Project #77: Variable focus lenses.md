# Variable focus lenses

Variable focus lenses that are electronically actuated are a new technology on the market that has untapped potential for vision care. 

## Motivation
It has become more apparent that environmental factors in diet, lighting, and exercise are prevailing factors in developing children and adult long term health. In short, cities are shaping us in detrimental ways. 

## Description 
infrared laser with interference projection mapped grid pattern to be projected on the back of the retina 

a camera system that would image the refraction index of the eye and map the distortion to measure how much the eye is focusing

An active electronically controlled variable lens that can adjust the focal length within a usable range

The feedback loop will dynamically try to keep the eye's focal distance in a constant resting spot, but allow for periods of exercise. 
This will allow for artificially inducing exercise fo the eye muscles tied to focusing such that they can be exercised in a manner t
hat better mimics mixed distance viewing while living in confined spaces.
