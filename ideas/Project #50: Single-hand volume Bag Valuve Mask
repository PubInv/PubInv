# Single-hand Volume Limited Bag Valve Mask

The Wikipedia artilce on [Bag Masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_valve_mask) makes clear that there are several improvements possible.

In practice, it is hard to maintain a mask seal by one practitioner, so two practitioners are sometimes used. 
Secondly, overinflation is a significant problem.

I propose to build a mechanical bag mask that is rigid, so that an operator may hold it with a pistol grip, delivering air 
by squeezing a handle (like a caulk gun), while apply pressure on that mask to the patient's face simultaneously.

At the same time, the "bag" can be made mechanically limited to only 500ml, and require a special action to create a
large volume, thus making it less likely that over inflation will occur.

It may be possible to use the squeezing action to provide a modicum of electric power. This could be used to 
provide audio queues as to pressure, so as to avoid over-presssurizing the lungs.

An emergency SPO2 meter could be mounted on new system, to be unclipped and clipped onto the patients finger to provide
emergency oxygen monitoring.
