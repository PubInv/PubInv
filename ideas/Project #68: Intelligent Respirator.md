# Project #68: Intelligent Respirator

The word "respirator" may refer to a simple mask or a powered air-purifying respirator. 
Lawrence Kincheloe @LokiMetaSmith propose making an intelligent respirator that can do much more than these current devices.

If a mask is equipped with a pressure and humidity sensor and an inhalation and/or exhalation port
is equipement with a flow sensor, then an intelligent respirator could:
1) Detect if it is attached to alive human
2) Enter emergency "forced breath" mode if it determines that a human is not breathing
3) Check for proper fit and seal and report leaks
4) Raise an alarm if breathing becomes labored otherwise distressed.
5) Perform moisture managment, to either dry or humidify incoming air as conditions change.
6) Conserve power and possibly oxygen by providing the minimum necessary positive pressure (which changes during the breath cycle.)

Robert Read adds the possibility of making a device which could be strapped on unconscious persons in a traumatic situaiton
and might be able to intelligently respirate them until a trained first responder can given them attention.

Current PAPRs already provided powered, filtered positive pressure air. Adding an embedded systme with
a microcontroller and more sensors could great expand the safety, utility, and comfort of the respirator.
The current [VentOS](https://gitlab.com/project-ventos/ventos) software provides a starting point for 
software to perform this.

This project would be make a good senior capstone engineering project. An open-source community around
the software for such a system could become a common ground of a small industry of firms making value-added
respirators based on this approach.
