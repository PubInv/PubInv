# Project #60: General Purpose Alaram Device

## Motivation

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Invention has been working on respiratory support devices, and has proposed a complete eco-system called [Freespireco](https://github.com/PubInv/freespireco).
One of many devices needed by Freespireco is a general purpose alarm device. That is, we need an easily controllable physical device that can alert people when
a problem occurs. In particular, when using a ventilator (whether through intubation or supporing spontaneous breathing), a large number of 
conditions can occur that require attention. These range in severity from routine tasks to life-critical problems that must be fixed quickly
to prevent death. These "alarm conditions" may represent machine failures, or they may be caused by patient behavior, such as vomiting or extended coughing
periods.

In a closed-source world, alarms are generally built into devices, and are not at all modular or composable. There is no incentive to make 
an alarm device open, reusable, modular, and reprogrammable.

If we had a cheap, reliable, easy-to-use physcial device, let's say about the size of a large smart phone, that could produce a loud and bright
alarm, we could use for innumerable purposes. It could be used for:
1. A ventilator
1. An Oxygen Concentrator
1. A pulsometer
1. A fire alarm
1. A smoke alarm
1. A carbon monoxide monitor
1. A burglar alarm
1. A personal safety alarm
1. A sleep apnea alarm
1. A baby monitor
1. ...and a whole lot more.
Although the [VentOS](https://gitlab.com/project-ventos/ventos) specifically needs this pandemic support, this project can and should be very versatile. 
I believe there would be considerable commercial demand from hobbyist for this device if it could be well-accomplished.

## Initial Design Ideas

This project could begin simply and be iterated easily. An Arduino Uno Protoshield is perhaps the easiest testable platform for the hardware.

The software design is largely a question of API design and standardization---one of the least glamorous and most valuable engineering activities.

The physical/mechanical/UX design would involve selecting sonic and visual devices and placing them in a box.

The UX design would particularly involve physical "silencing" mechanisms.

## Advanced Ideas and Research

"Alarm Fatigue" and "Alarm Management" are very serious academic subjects. This project could construct an ideal open platform for researchers to do work in
that field.

An ideal device would be accessible by an I2C and SPI interface, as well as a serial port and bluetooth radio.

An ideal device would be able to provide 140 characters of additional information about the alarm condition as well.

## Project Organization

This is an idea project for iterative development. It would be valuable with relative easy work, but it is open-ended and there is no limit to how much
work could be put into it. It also is a foundational part of life-saving technology and highly commercializable.
