# Internal Combustion Food Cooker

Generally much of the world cooks with flame on the oustide of a pot.

Instead, we can imagine a combustion chamber immersed inside the bot. Suppose that this chamber was filled
originally with sufficient charcoal to, under ideal conditions, boil an entire pot of water.
Assume that in an insulated pot, bringing the food to a boil and then waiting would be sufficient to 
cook rice or beans.

Such a system could be extraordinarily fuel efficient. If we temporarily put aside safety
concerns and imagine we have a perfect material, we can imagine pumping a sufficient mass of 
air to contiain enough oxygen to complete combust the charcoal. This would be a very high pressure.
If we (theoretically) wait until all the air is present, then ignite the carbon/air mixture,
we would have an explosion, in a sense, inside a contained vessel. The vessel would become very
hot. Being immersed in a pot of water, most of the heat would be transferred to the water over time.

This is of course impractical, but we can do something similar on a smaller scale. 
We pump a tiny amout of charcoal and large amount of compressed air into chamber, combust it,
wait for it to cool, then vent the (high pressure) gases though an insulated paper. We then 
refill the chamber and repeat this process. Not unlike the cycle of an internal comustion engine,
we are cycle through sufficient fuel to complete the heating process. Each stroke of our
internal combustion engine, which is not meant to provide power, transfers more heat to the pot.

Although complicated compared to placing a pot over firewood, the radical efficiency of this
may have tremendous benefits. How much charcoal would be needed? I am guessing that a
"campfire" style heating is extremely inefficient. Possibly and internal combustion heater
could be 5 or 10 times more efficient in terms of overall fuel. That is a radical savings that
could make it affordable, even if the internal combustion heater itself is relatively expensive.

Although we could test the theory with liquid fuel, I believe granulated charcoal is the fuel 
that ulimately makes sense.

Obviously, safety valves will have to be provided, and safety is the fundamental engineering
problem which must be solved here.

Nonetheless, one would begin be analysing the heating capacity of charcoal relative to a pot of
beans in order to determine the mass of charcoal required. From their, would would work out 
the mass of air required, and design a pumping system to employ it.

Although it is tempting to imagine a continuous forced-air system, I doubt that is as efficient
as sealed-chamber cycling system.
