# More efficient pot

Deisgn a pot, possibly using spirals, to create a more efficient way to heat water on a stove.  
For example, insulate the pot, and duct the air through the middle of the pot.  
Additioanlly, one can even imagine a very intelligent pot that opens and closes vents based on the 
temperature of the air in the pots.

# Note: May already be fully explored

After writing up this idea, I found that "pot skirts" are already believed to be an effective way to improve heating.
An example is: http://stoves.bioenergylists.org/content/pot-skirt-investigat

I don't know if anyone has tried the helical vane idea.

## Success Criteria

Basically we want to build a pot that you can place on a stove and heat water faster (or with less heat and fuel)
than a standard pot. This makes a very clear success criteria.

## Stories

* I believe one of the easiest things to do here would be to make a "pot shroud" out of metal (I have experience with aluminum.)  The idea is that it would be a cylinder to cover both the pot and the flame, with "legs" so that sufficient oxygen enterred at the bottom.  The shroud could have the helical vanes that I love so much, carefully sized to sit close to the pot, hopefully creating an airflow that was in contact with the pot longer.  Then just see if water boiled faster on the same gas setting.
