# More efficient pot

Deisgn a pot, possibly using spirals, to create a more efficient way to heat water on a stove.  
For example, insulate the pot, and duct the air through the middle of the pot.  
Additioanlly, one can even imagine a very intelligent pot that opens and closes vents based on the 
temperature of the air in the pots.

# Note: May already be fully explored

After writing up this idea, I found that "pot skirts" are already believed to be an effective way to improve heating.
An example is: http://stoves.bioenergylists.org/content/pot-skirt-investigat

I don't know if anyone has tried the helical vane idea.

This invention, the Miito might also be a worthwhile approach: https://vimeo.com/108997936
As it promotes more efficiency by warming what's used (vs. a lager quantity)

## Success Criteria

Basically we want to build a pot that you can place on a stove and heat water faster (or with less heat and fuel)
than a standard pot. This makes a very clear success criteria.

## Stories

* I believe one of the easiest things to do here would be to make a "pot shroud" out of metal (I have experience with aluminum.)  The idea is that it would be a cylinder to cover both the pot and the flame, with "legs" so that sufficient oxygen enterred at the bottom.  The shroud could have the helical vanes that I love so much, carefully sized to sit close to the pot, hopefully creating an airflow that was in contact with the pot longer.  Then just see if water boiled faster on the same gas setting.
* Make the test shroud out of aluminum foil.  Extremely easy to fabricate


## Note: new ideas

I think it is worth exploring the idea of an integrated wood-buring stove/cooking pot.  Although it sounds dangerous, we might be able to make a stove in which pressurized air is added (repetitively) to a very small chamber comtaining a simple 
fuel like a small piece of wood.  We would then use "internal" combustion, and not let the combustion products escape until
the heat is transferred to the cooking product.

This seems very complicated, but if you could boil X grams of water in Y seconds with Z grams of ordinary wood, it
could be extrmely valuable depending on the values of X,Y, and Z.

I would really like to work on this idea.  Unfortunately, I need someone to start working on The Gluss Project before I can put this down.

To review the problem: much of the world still cooks on open fires. If we can develop more efficient stoves, this could make
a huge difference.

Note that the simple fact that people don't have enough capital to purchase stoves (wood-burning) may be a bigger 
problem than the lack of efficient stoves.  It is no good developing a new stove it if we can't distribute it to people.
Of course, I'm willing to work on the financial problem of stove distribution as well.

Note further that at some level of efficiency this becomse a good way to treat human waste.

## Basic Design Idea

The design below has an integrated fire box, which goes beyond the idea of a basic pot, but the principles could apply in both cases.

One can easily imagine a variant of this idea to make a "fire griddle" with a similar heat exchanger consiting of a spiral tubes.
The exhuast tube would go under a griddle, and the intake tube would be beneath that. A height elevation in the chimney and air intake
would still be required to insure air flow in the correct direction.

## Manufacturing Note: Aluminum casting is pretty easy

I have taken a class on room-temperatue vulcanization (that is, silicone molding) that allows room-temperature casting.  The materials used in this process can not easily be used to make cookware. However, the whole process, particularly, in combination with 3D printers, open up the possibility of casting complex, heat-efficient shapes.

## An additional idea: The Fire Spider
