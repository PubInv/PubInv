Build a “blanket” that can be placed over a fallen log to make biochar in place.

The basic idea is to make something that can be transported easily and could char a log or brush pile in place without needing to transport the log out, which is very costly.

This would allow someone to have a brushpile turned into biochar safely.

One way to think about this would be to build a geodesic dome.  Essentially it we would be building a portable retort.   This would allow us to char quickly in place.

On youtube “Biochar workshop” you can see a lot of advantage of his.  This is a carbon sequestration idea.  

This could be done on a very small scale safely.

We could construct this out of iron, and fold it up like a geodesic dome.  As shown, we need to control oxygen flow to turn this into a retort.  It has to have a chimney.  It has to a

Note that one of the wonderful things about this is our ability to this in a very small scale.

## Basic storification:

Build the device with manual controls.  Test that it works.
Add instrumentation.
Add an Arduino control.
Scale up.
