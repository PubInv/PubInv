# Personal Cooling Pad

## Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the value of having manufacturable open-source designs available before a disaster strikes.
Due to global heating we can reliably predict heat waves will be not just fatal, but calamitous in places where it is both 
moist and warm, defeating the human sweating mechanism which is very efficient in dry climates. The maybe entire cities 
that become untenable when the web-bulb temperature rises too high.

## Basic approach

We can assume that a wealthy place where air conditioning is wide spread would suffer in a long heat wave, but it would not be
a calamity. However, in a poor place, people might have no cool shelter at all. They might simply have to leave, and 
some of them might not  be able to.

Therefore what we need to do is design a cooling system for the very poorest that can be quickly manufactured on 
a large scale (and perhaps stockpiled.) It would have to use minimal power---we cannot assume widespread affordable
and reliable electricity in this situation.

Therefore we must have a radical solution: not air conditioning, but direct chilling of the body with some sort
of clothing. Perhaps we can make a "chilling pad" not unlike a "heating pad". This would allow most of the 
heat extraction to be appied directly to the human body. It would be unpleasant, but it would keep the frail 
alive in a masive heat wave.

Refrigeration is about 20 times harder than heating, in general. It is not terribly efficient, either. 

What I am imagining is a small electromechnanical system using standard compression-of-refrigerant based cooling
that pumps a cool liquid next to the body.

Possibly, we could use alcohol or air (so-called "dense air") or ammonia for this application. We could not
imagine enormous amounts of standard refrigerants being available.

I can't see any solution that doesn't involved solar power and batteries.

We can clearly imagine giving 100,000 persons each a small solar panel, a battery, and chill pad,
and a small appliance that chills. The problems are:
1. Can it be made safe?
1. Can it be either cheap or quick to manufacture?
1. Can the power consumption for a 24-hour chilling period be accomplished on one batter charge?
1. How big would the battery have to be?
1. Can we organized a socio-political structure, such as a for-profit firm, to manufacture them?

# Research

I have done know direct research on this idea yet. I would be greatful if somoeone would start that work and submit
well-vetted citations via a pull-request or an issue. Thank you, Public Inventors! The time to do this is NOW,
before disaster strikes.

# Work at Rice University

A freshman design team at Rice University is working on this problem.
They are building a water pump system to pump cold water into tubes around the head, cooling it. They are not tackling the much harder
problem of chilling the water itself.
