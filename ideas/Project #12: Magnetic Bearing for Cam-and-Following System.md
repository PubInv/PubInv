I have already devised a more efficient ICE controller which uses a track or rail rather than purely circular motion, allow for a both quick return and more theoretically efficient construction.

However, this is mechanically a difficult thing to construct.

What if we build a CVT based on my “changing slope” concept that usess magnetic bearings?  The idea is to mount bearing on the end of rods that can move.  Then arrange the bearings continuously to provide computer control of the bearing system, allows almost any output system to be produced from the input oscillations.
